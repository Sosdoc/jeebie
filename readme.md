# Jeebie [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sosdoc/jeebie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sosdoc/jeebie)
A gameboy emulator written in Rust.

## Status
The emulator is in a very early stage and cannot run anything yet. At this point any part might go under substantial
changes while I learn more about the hardware, language, libraries, etc.

For more details on the architecture and development process check out the [development notes](./notes.md).
